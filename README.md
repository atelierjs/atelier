# Atelier - a modern framework built for React and Sass.

TODO: describe the concept/vision (scss/css framework with pre-built react components) and how to use in a React app and standalone.

## Getting Started

To get up and running immediately, simply clone the project and run these commands from the root project directory:

- `yarn install`
- `yarn start`

## Husky Setup

To initialize husky, first make sure to `yarn install` as above, then run `yarn prepare` once, which will connect the husky pre-commit hook to git. This is being used to enforce formatting on all staged files before committing them to git.
